# Cheat-Sheet-Central
Had to create a project as an intro do Web developing and I took the opportunity to put a idea I had:
A webpage to gather all the cheat sheets, like terminal commands and keyboard shortcuts from the most used tools.

Besides adding more commands and different pages, an idea that i have for now is adding a copy to clipboard button.
Other issues for now: The footer it's not behaving very well with the bootstrap class and the tables are not well aligned if using in mobile
