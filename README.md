# Cheat-Sheet-Central
Had to create a project as an intro do Web developing and I took the opportunity to put a idea I had:
A webpage to gather all the cheat sheets, like terminal commands and keyboard shortcuts from the most used tools.

Besides adding more commands and different pages, some ideas we had is adding a copy to clipboard button and an extra page called quizz so the client can test some knowledge.
Other known issues: The footer it's not behaving very well with the bootstrap class i've used and the tables are not well aligned if opened in mobile.
