# Cheat-Sheet-Central
Hi! So, I had to create a project as an intro do Web developing and I took the opportunity to create a idea I was thinking:
A webpage to gather all the cheat sheets like terminal commands and keyboard shortcuts, from the most used tools.

- Yes, we could make it so much better with jinja and using some framework already, but let's just keep it very simple for now so more beginners can contribute and practice coding and open source skills.


Besides adding more commands and different pages, some ideas we had is adding a copy to clipboard button and an extra page called quizz so the users can test their knowledge.
Other known issues: The tables are not well aligned if opened in mobile.
